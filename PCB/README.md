# PCB

The PCB is designed using KiCAD.  The schematic is based around that of the Arduino Pro Mini, with an ATmega328P clocked at 16 MHz on a 5V supply.  There are pin headers for connecting an I2C NRF24L01+ radio module (which has a dedicated 3.3V supply), an I2C LCD display, some LEDs and some switches and analog sticks.  There is also a potential divider for reading the battery voltage.
