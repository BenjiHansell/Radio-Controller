# 3D Design

The 3D design currently only comprises of two parts; a chasis and a back plate.  The analog sticks are not currently 3D printed, though I have made a few prototypes.

A third part which I used but did not design myself is [the knob for the rotary encoder](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:646348).

I print the parts at a 0.3 mm layer height on a cheap FDM 3D printer and then sand and spray paint for a nice finish.
